# Service-Based Antipatterns

This repository should serve as a knowledge base for Service-Based Antipatterns and has been created due to a study project at the University of Stuttgart.

The basis of the antipatterns has been collected by applying a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which has been documented [here](https://github.com/xJREB/service-based-antipatterns/blob/master/SLR.md).
Anyone can contribute with new antipatterns to this project by following the contribution guidelines specified [here](https://github.com/xJREB/service-based-antipatterns/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The repository has been created
1. to collect the information in a structured way (JSON)
2. to give additional researchers an easy way to contribute their antipatterns
3. to version the results

The results are presented in a modern design on the Service-Based Antipatterns [website](https://xjreb.github.io/service-based-antipatterns/) which focuses on
1. presenting all the collected antipatterns in an uncluttered way
2. presenting all the details of each antipattern in a nicely formatted detail view
3. providing an easy way search any antipattern
4. providing an easy way to apply filters to see only specific antipatterns
5. providing an easy way to share the url of any antipattern
6. providing an easy way to copy the json representation of any antipattern
7. providing an easy to cite the source(s) of any antipattern
