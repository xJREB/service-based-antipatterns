This repository should serve as a knowledge base for service-based antipatterns and has been created in a research project at the University of Stuttgart.

The preliminary list of antipatterns has been collected by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which has been documented [here](https://github.com/xJREB/service-based-antipatterns/blob/master/SLR.md).
Anyone can update existing antipatterns or contribute new ones to this project by following the guidelines specified [here](https://github.com/xJREB/service-based-antipatterns/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The repository has been created
1. to collect and browse antipatterns in a structured and uniform way (JSON format)
2. to give researchers and practitioners an easy way to access the collection and contribute their antipatterns
3. to version the results

The collection is visible on the Service-Based Antipatterns [website](https://xjreb.github.io/service-based-antipatterns/) which
1. presents the list of collected antipatterns in an uncluttered way
2. presents the details of each antipattern in a formatted detail view
3. provides functionality to search, filter, and sort antipatterns
4. enables the URL sharing of any antipattern
5. provides functionality to copy the JSON representation of any antipattern
6. provides functionality to cite the source(s) of any antipattern
