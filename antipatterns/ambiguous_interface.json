      "description": "The interface of a service offers a single and very general operation.",
      "context":  "",
      "detection": "A service implements a large amount of functionality, but provides only one public operation to invoke all of it. Accepted requests are internally forwarded to various methods.",
      "consequences": "Analyzability and understandability are reduced, because the service does not publish all its provided functionality in a clear manner. Therefore, a user has to analyze the implementation of the service before using it.",
      "cause": "May easily appear in pub-sub systems, where interactions are not explicitly modeled and multiple services exchange event messages via a shared event bus.",
      "solution": "Split the single generic operation into multiple more specialized operations.",
      "example": "Interface with a single public operation that takes a generic type as parameter.",
