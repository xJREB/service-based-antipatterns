      "description": "Is an antipattern where the interfaces of a component offer a single and very general entry-point. ",
      "context":  "",
      "detection": "Interface offers and processes multiple services, but offers only one public service. Usually all requests are accepted and internally other services are invoked.",
      "consequences": "Reduce analyzability and understandability, because the component does not show the services that are accepted. Therefore a user has to analyze the implementation of the component before using it.",
      "cause": "Especially appears in pub-sub systems, where the interactions are not explicitly modeled and multiple components exchange event messages via a shared event bus.",
      "solution": "Split single-entry point up into multiple more specialized entry-points.",
      "example": "Interface with a single public method that takes a generic type as parameter.",
