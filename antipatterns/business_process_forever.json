      "description": "This antipattern describes the problem that once business processes have been well defined they should not be changed easily if ever.",
      "context": "The antipattern applies mostly to smaller and medium sized businesses in small economies where business processes are not stable or not enough data of good quality is available to create stable business processes.",
      "detection": "",
      "consequences": "The owner of a business process has almost no responsibility of its consequences since he can not change its structure. This way he can only act as an observer.",
      "cause": "Business processes have been well defined and should only be changed by experts or expert teams. Therefore, the business processes should not be changed easily if ever by the business men responsible for it.",
      "solution": "The user has to be involved in the business processes and therefore, user-oriented interfaces have to be created.",
