      "description": "Services implement large amounts of low-level interaction-related functionality, e.g. for communication, coordination, conversation, or facilitation. These functionalities should be implemented by a connector instead.",
      "context": "",
      "detection": "",
      "consequences": "Reusability is reduced, because these low-level details are too specific and not agnostic enough. Understandability is reduced, because different concerns are mixed. Testability is reduced, because the connector and service funtionality cannot be tested separately.",
      "cause": "Performance may have been preferred over maintainability, since separation of connector and service functionality would create an additional level of indirection. This sometimes also leads to new threads or processes.",
      "solution": "Extract the interaction-related functionality into a separate connector service.",
      "example": "Service A implements communication and facilitation services. It also imports a communication library, which means that it manages networking facilities for remote communication. But the delivery and routing services handled by the remote communication are a type of facilitation service ",
