      "description": "This antipattern describes that two connectors of different types are used to link a pair of components.",
      "context": "",
      "detection": "",
      "consequences": "Using two different types of connectors may cancel the benefit of each one out. Additionally, the adaptability and the understandability are reduced.",
      "cause": "Can be accidentially introduced by trying to overcome another issue. For example when always the same type of connector was used, but to avoid unnecessary network traffic, it was implemented that one service can adress another service directly.",
      "solution": "Use e.g. an additional event bus instead of direct access.",
      "example": "Component B can directly access Component A, but they are also connected through an event bus.",
