      "description": "Practices of OO programming or other non-SOA architectures are used in service orientation (SO) because the features of SO have not been understood.",
      "context": "Experienced object oriented (OO) developers don't see new features in SO and apply their OO practices to SO.",
      "detection": "If a service supports or computerizes human activities it should not use RPC.",
      "consequences": "Using this antipattern leads to poorly usable interfaces.",
      "cause": "Experienced developers fail to see new features of SO which is why they attempt to use all practices of OO in SO. Often you end up in this antipattern if you have a system in transition from another architectural style to SOA.",
      "solution": "If RPC is used often the system has to be rewritten from scratch or legacy systems have to rewritten in particular.",
      "example": "Use SOAP only as an envelop of RPC calls and limit service interfaces only to RPC.",
