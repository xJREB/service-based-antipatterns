      "description": "This antipattern describes a frequent implementation of SOA where one elementary service is used per software component resulting in many small software components that are sharing data.",
      "context": "SOA is often implemented by having one elementary service per software component.",
      "detection": "Many small software components share data.",
      "consequences": "Inefficiencies and big maintenance problems due to the large amount of small software components.",
      "cause": "The antipattern is caused by a wrong grouping of \"atomic\" capabilities.",
      "solution": "Regroup related elementary services into one software component with a common interface.",
      "example": "Many highly specialized car service workshops are working separately. It is not an enterprise that provides all car repair services at one spot.",
